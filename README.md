### :speaker: This project was built on the basis and total reference of the classes made available at Omnistack 11.0 Week made available by ![RocketSeat](https://rocketseat.com.br/)

## :straight_ruler: Techs used in the project

**Backend**: A RESTful API was built using Node.js, Express, Cors, etc.. This API was then integrated with a SQLite database using Knex. By the end of the development process, data validation on the routes was implemented using the Celebrate library. Unit and integration tests were developed using Jest, Supertest and cross-env libraries.

**Website**: The website frontend was built using ReactJS.

**Mobile App**: The app was built using React Native and Expo.

**Deploy**: The deploy was done using two services, one service to deploy the backend and another to deploy the frontend. I used Heroku to deploy the backend due to having a good free plan for small applications like this. For the frontend, I wanted to test a service called Netlify due to the ease of using it and the free plan they also offer.
